# Hochschulhaus Garching iOS App

A native iOS application for the [Hochschulhaus Garching](https://www.eswm.de/haeuser/hochschulhaus-garching.html) student dormitory.
This project evolved from a spare time coding exercise I started for the dormitory I was living in during my studies.
The app grew significantly in terms of functionality and integrates a custom calendar, financial system capabilities and students contact list.
The project uses [Google Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) to enable push notifications and [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) animations.

> It's [available on the official Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/hhg/id1534580488) but can only be used for residents of the dormitory.
